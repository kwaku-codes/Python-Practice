# Python-Practice

A repo to show all the ways I am learning how to use Python. I am following along with a Youtube course provided by NetWork Chuck.
I am hoping that having this repo online will show future employers my skills with Python.
This is also just a way for me to keep track of everything I am doing and have everything in one IDE rather than scattered about.
